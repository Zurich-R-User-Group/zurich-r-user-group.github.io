Contribution to R itself is not as far away as many useRs - even the more tenured of us - think.
In fact, contribution is a great chance for intermediate and advanced R developers to take the next step on their R journey.
Now, the *R Contribution Working Group* helps motivated developers to get started with a digestable working package and connects new contributors to some of the best developers of our community in the process.


## How is R Even Possible?

In the last decades the R Project for Statistical Computing went from domain specific niche to one of the richest, most popular and impactful tools in computational statistics, data science and beyond. 
Lead by a group of main developers called *R Core* who steadily work on the R language itself, community groups and package authors have designed, created and maintained a wonderful ecosystem. 
While some packages and approaches have reached remarkable heights, impact and popularity on their own, base R, maintained by R core, is still the common, reliable ground that keeps the R community together. 


## From Local Contribution to Global Impact

Though work on the R language itself is widely taken care of by said well established group of R stalwarts, it is crucial to the sustainability of the R project to establish contribution from the wider R community.
Given that the Zurich R user group is one the longest tenured and most active R user groups in Europe, we would like to encourage our readers to consider contributing to the R Project itself.

Contribution to a well established opensource collaboration is a challenging and rewarding experience at the same time:
Contribution can be very different from putting your head down and plowing through one's own problem. 
To be part of something global and to follow paths paved by others has the potential to unlock your personal next level as software developer and possibly an entire careers. 
In any case, contribution to a global opensource project is a chance to learn from some of the very best in the field.

Thanks to the R Contribution Working group, the hurdle to contribute to the R project itself has become considerably lower.
The group is a collaboration of different community groups with R Core and it does plenty of things to help you get involved: 

- r-devel presence on GitHub as opposed to SVN only
- organization of participation in Google Summer of Code / Google Summer of Docs projects to fund contribution
- R contributor events 
- R contributor Slack space
- GitHub Workspace and devpod based environments to facilitate compilation
- R Development Guide


## Ok, How Can I Really Start?

One good starting point is to browse through R's bug reports on bugzilla to get a feel for current issues. 
Good beginner issues are relatively narrow in scope, not extremely recent nor too old.
Also, translations or pre-release tests are a good way to help.
In the below video taken from the R Contribution Working Group's website, Heather and Ella give you 
further ideas and more details on getting starting with contribution to R.
