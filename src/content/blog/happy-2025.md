We hope you enjoyed a peaceful and recreational festive season and already had a great start to your 2025.
On our part, we are excited to see what 2025 has in store for the Zurich R community. The end of 2024 brought 
one of the biggest changes to the R user group in almost a decade: R community legends Muriel, Rachel and Dorothea 
said <a href="">Farewell to an Incredible Journey with the Zurich R User Group (RUG)</a> after more than 40 (!!) meetups,
leaving giant shoes to fill. 

## The must go on at WSL

But Muriel, Rachel and Dorothea would not be themselves, if they hadn't looked out for the community and the first events without them. 
When we started to figure things out as the new organizers, the groundwork for "Geodata and Landscape Insights with R" was already laid.
 




2024 is in the books and we hope you are as excited about 2025 as we are.
