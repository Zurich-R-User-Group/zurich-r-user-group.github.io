## Looking Back on 2025 — and a Peek to What’s Next

What a year it’s been for the **Zurich R User Group**! As we wrap up 2025 (and ride into the new year), we want to take a moment to reflect on the great moments we shared — and invite you to join us for our next Meetup on the **29. January, 2026: DevOps in R**.

### A Year of Learning, Sharing, and Growing Together

This past year, we’ve hosted 3 Meetups, ranging from deep dives into mobility analytics to climate-resilient forest modeling in R. 

Some highlights:

- In **September**, we explored *R for Mobility & Transportation Analytics* at the University of Zurich with Samuel Wittwer from VBZ and Anna Reiffer at ETH
- In **June**, we hosted a **SummeR BeeR** Meetup where we had a more relaxed community based meetup
- And earlier in the year, our **WinteR Meetup** at WSL Birmensdorf brought together ecology, forest health, and geospatial R workflows — with twotalks on infrastructure planning and the FORTE app, from Volodymyr Trotsuik and Dominique Weber

These meetups wouldn’t have been possible without our wonderful hosts, speakers, sponsors, and — most importantly — every single one of **you** who came out, asked questions, and made our R community lively and supportive.

### What’s Next? JanuaRy DevOps Meetup on the Horizon

We’re excited to kick off the new year with our first meetup on the **29th January, 2026** at the Swiss Economic Institute (KOF-ETH). With our Speakers Oliver Müller from KOF-IT and Patrick Schratz from Codefloe - we will learn more about how to use R for DevOps!

Expect the same welcoming spirit, rich technical content, and an apéro at the end.

Thank you to everyone who made 2025 a memorable year. We look forward to seeing you in January — and can’t wait to grow, learn, and build together in the year ahead.

Happy New Year — and happy coding!
